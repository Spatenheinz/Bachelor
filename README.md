Run using .NET core 3.1
Each of the Cryptographic functions is contained in its own folder. Every iteration of each of these can be found in subdirectory and is contained as its own C# project. opt\<number\> folders corresopnds to pipelined versions. Each folder should also contain a hdl folder which is used to generate the ip in Xilinx Vivado. Likewise each subfolder has a .bd file. With this one should be able to recrate the results as reported in the report.
