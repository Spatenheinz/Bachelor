  Critical work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The Dependency routing needs to be fixed in the hashing functions.
  \item Make hashes able to switch between messages to circumvent the stalling.
  \item Make a useful interface to expose our implementations.
  \end{itemize}
  Optimizing work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Investigate SHA hopefully getting the performance to reasonable levels
    \item Test if different approaches of AES approaches could yield better performance.
          Sugestions:\\
          1. Naive but pipelined\\
          2. Stateful BRAM.
  \end{itemize}
  Comparing work
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Compare to other research papers results which often are written in HDL to see if SME can actually provide comparable results. This would require better a better FPGA.
    \item Test against a GPU.
  \end{itemize}
