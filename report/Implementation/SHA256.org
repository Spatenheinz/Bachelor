** SHA256
The implementation of SHA256 is very similar to that of the implementation of MD5,
since they both are hashing algorithms of the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction.
The major differences is that SHA uses big endian encodings while MD5 uses little endian.

The naive unoptimized SHA256 implementation upholds the same general structure in the code, including the padding and block fetching as the naive MD5.
The only difference is that the output digest is 256 bits, so an array of eight 32 bit unsigned integers,
and the format is changed from little endian to big endian in the padding and fetch block routines.

The SHA256 algorithm is located in the ~processBlock()~ routine.
The routine has the input block stored in the first 16 entires of the array ~blockD[]~.
Then these blocks get expanded in the following way


%% If need should arise it would be simple to extend
%% the implementation of SHA256 to these other versions since it would mostly
%% consist of changing preset constants.
