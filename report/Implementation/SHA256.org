** SHA256
SHA256 is a one way Secure Hash Algorithm. Which is where it gets its name from.
It is part of the SHA2 familiy and was designed and published by the NSA.
SHA256 is also build upon the Merkle-Damg√•rd construction, like MD5.

The 256 part refers to the output size of 256-bit.
SHA256 can take in input of any size (depending on the implementation) but works
on chunks of 512-bits and then outputs a digest or hash of 256-bits.
Other versions from the SHA2 familiy exsits, like SHA512 and the truncated
versions like SHA224 and SHA384. If need should arise it would be simple to extend
the implementation of SHA256 to these other versions since it would mostly
consist of changing preset constants.
