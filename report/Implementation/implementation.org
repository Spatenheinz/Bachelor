* Implementation

We will be using the streaming AXI protocol (from hereon just called AXI) for all implementations. AXI is a lightweight protocol for synchronizing data transactions between hardware components. It specifies some standards for a ready/valid handshake between components. This means that whenever a Master component is valid to send data over a bus, and the slave is ready to receive data simultaneously, a transaction is completed.
