The subject of running and optimizing hash functions on FPGAs is not new. One work on this subject is "Improving SHA-2 Hardware Implementation", by R. Chaves, G. Kuzmanov, L. Sousa, and S. Vassiliadis.
The most significant increase they documented in their report was a throughput increase of 40% on a VIRTEX II Pro FPGA(XC2P30-7) board\footnote{This is an article and FPGA, however, the optimizations are still interesting and might still be worth investigating.}.
The increase comes from measuring their own implementation against a commercial product (Helion) on the same board.

The improvements they found were some rescheduling of operations. SHA-2 is designed to have data dependency for previous rounds.
So values of round $i$ can not be computed until round $i-1$ is finished, making unrolling and pipelining almost impossible.
They did find some values and techniques they could optimize without increasing the circuit size much, which is usually a problem.

One improvement they did were to pre-calculate all possible values needed in round $i+1$ in round $i$.
Of the variables A-H, only A and E are dependent on calculations, the rest just gets shifted. So the following was done:
\begin{align}
E_{t+1} &= D_t+\Sigma_1(E_t)+Ch(E_t,F_t,G_t)+H_t+K_t+W_t\\
A_{t+1} &= \Sigma_0(A_t)+Maj(B_t,C_t,D_t)+\Sigma(E_t)+Ch(E_t,F_t,G_t)+H_t+K_t+W_t\\
\Downarrow\\
E_{t+1} &= D_t+\Sigma_1(E_t)+Ch(E_t,F_t,G_t)+\sigma_t\\
A_{t+1} &= \Sigma_0(A_t)+Maj(B_t,C_t,D_t)+\Sigma(E_t)+Ch(E_t,F_t,G_t)+\sigma_t
\end{align}
Where $\sigma_t = H_t + K_t + W_t = G_{t-1} + K_t + W_t$.

In the future we could test this strategy, along with the other changes they describe. Such as decreasing the curcuit size by generalizing the computations for the digested message (DM):
\begin{align}
DM(j+4)_i &= E_{t-3+j} + DM(j+4)_{i-1}\qquad \text{for } 1\leq j \leq 3\\
DM(j)_i &= A_{t-3+j} + DM(j)_{i-1}\qquad \text{for } 1\leq j \leq 3
\end{align}
# 1 Operation rescheduling, E_(t+1) og A_(t+1) kan optimeres ved at lave nogle af udregningerne tidligere. DM_1-DM_3, DM_5-DM_7 kan ogs√• udregnes tidligere
# 2 Hardware specifications, circular buffer? BRAM?
# 3 results
